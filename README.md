## Theme : Healthcare
## Title of Project : Shelter

### Summary of Project
Many people don't want to share their problems and choose to shut themselves because of some reasons (trust issues, shame, etc). Our project  purpose is to make a way to share a user's problem without worrying about the user's privacy and match with the user's personality. According to WHO’s data, every 40 seconds, one person dies by committing suicide[1](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4391681/tingkat-bunuh-diri-indonesia-dibanding-negara-negara-lain),  where suicide occurs because of a mental health disorder. That’s why we want to help people strengthen each other so they don’t give up on their lives.
